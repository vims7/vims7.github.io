              You knew about my fight with Zenia, and yet you didn't jump to the conclusion that I was being an ass. You asked me about it, listened to what I had to say, and told me what to do about it.

              When we were walking back from Liwa, I was annoying you about your shoes, you got really close to my face and said something. I don't remember it, because I was too busy staring at you. The look + you getting close to me was pretty hot.

              You picked up the heart that said "you're my type" and showed it to me. Smooth. Later, we sang the best songs together while walking. As soon as you left, I thought "yep. she's the one."

              You said "I love you" to me in Biology class, across the room. I just said it back with no reaction, but that was because I was dying inside. It was so cute that I lost the ability to react. I smiled about that the entire day, just so you know. You're a blessing.

              You grabbed my hand while we were walking in Burjuman, but you did it in this cute way. You held my pinky first with yours, and slowly moved to my entire hand. Later, when I told you on text that you didn't owe me for making me come to sports day, you replied with "Really?", like you were genuinely happy I said that. Heck yes really you absolute loser.
