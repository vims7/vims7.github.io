              You knew about my fight with Zenia, and yet you didn't jump to the conclusion that I was being an ass. You asked me about it, listened to what I had to say, and told me what to do about it.

              You grabbed my hand while we were walking in Burjuman, but you did it in this cute way. You held my pinky first with yours, and slowly moved to my entire hand. Later, when I told you on text that you didn't owe me for making me come to sports day, you replied with "Really?", like you were genuinely happy I said that. Heck yes really you absolute loser.
